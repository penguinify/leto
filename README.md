# leto
rust wrapper for discord
- main priority is to offer as close to the default discord experience as possible, and improve from there


# goals
- [x] Non native discord features
- [ ] RPC (Rust implementation later)
- [ ] OS Tray + window features
- [ ] Notifications and sound
- [ ] Global keybinds
- [ ] Support for ARM, Linux, and Windows (Only OSX ARM + x86 for now since I don't have a Linux or Windows machine)
- [ ] Native JS injection for client mods
- [x] Faster and lighter than Discord + OpenASAR (9s launch time) (this will always be ongoing but currently it starts in a few seconds)
- [ ] No Jank
- [ ] VC Support
- [ ] Link support
- [ ] Multiple input and output devices
- [ ] Support for vencord, betterdiscord, equicord, and replugged.
- [ ] Support for custom js
- [ ] As close to default discord as possible
